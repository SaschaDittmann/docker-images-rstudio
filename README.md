This Docker Image is for development & testing purposes ONLY.

It is based on the [rocker/rstudio](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio-stable/) image, and adds the Microsoft Machine Learning Server platform on top of it.

## Quickstart
```
docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=yourpasswordhere bytesmith/rstudio
```

Visit *localhost:8787* in your browser and log in with username *rstudio* and the password you set. 

**Note:** Setting a password is now REQUIRED. Container will error otherwise.

## Give the user root permissions (add to sudoers)
```
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e ROOT=TRUE -e PASSWORD=yourpasswordhere bytesmith/rstudio
```

Link a local volume (in this example, the current working directory, $(pwd)) to the rstudio container:

```
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -v $(pwd):/home/rstudio -e PASSWORD=yourpasswordhere bytesmith/rstudio
```

## Bypassing the authentication step

**Warning:** use only in a secure environment. Do not use this approach on an
Azure or other cloud machine with a publicly accessible IP address.

Simply set the environmental variable *DISABLE_AUTH=true*, e.g.

```
docker run --rm \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8787:8787 \
  -e DISABLE_AUTH=true \
  bytesmith/rstudio
```

Navigate to *http://localhost:8787* and you should be logged into RStudio as
the *rstudio* user without needing a password.

## Access a root shell for a running rstudio container instance
First, determine the name or id of your container (unless you provided a --name to docker run) using docker ps. You need just enough of the hash id to be unique, e.g. the first 3 letters/numbers. Then exec into the container for an interactive session:

```
docker exec -ti <CONTAINER_ID> bash
```

You can now perform maintenance operations requiring root behavior such as apt-get, adding/removing users, etc.

Or, simply enable root as shown above and use the RStudio bash terminal.
